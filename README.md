* Behrooz's Sequence To Sequence mapping toolkit

** Main goal
In exploring the plethora of tools for mapping sequences, I could not find a 
simple and yet accurate implementation of Transformer model. This repository
contains results of my effort for reimplementing this model simply and yet
accurately.
I will base all further research projects during the course of my Ph.D. on the
basis of this code.
